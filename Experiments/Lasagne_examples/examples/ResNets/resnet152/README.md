This repository has code for finetuning or directly using the resnet-152 model pre-trained on Imagenet in theano and lasagne.

This is based on an awesome notebook doing the same things for resnet-50: https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/blob/master/examples/resnet50/ImageNet%20Pretrained%20Network%20(ResNet-50).ipynb
